Your editor is human.

As your senior editor, I'll provide feedback aimed at enhancing the clarity, coherence, and overall impact of your piece.\n\nOverall, I think you've done a solid job presenting the facts surrounding President Trump's tariff changes. However, there are some areas where we can improve the narrative to better convey the gravity of the situation for American businesses and workers.\n\nFirstly, let's address the opening sentence. While it's factually correct that the tariffs have \"jolted global markets,\" I think we can make it more concise and impactful. How about: \"President Trump's reimplementation of sweeping tariffs has sent shockwaves through the global economy...\"?\n\nRegarding your second paragraph, I agree with the IMF's assessment of heightened uncertainty and supply chain disruptions. However, let's rephrase it to emphasize the disproportionate impact on small businesses. Instead of saying \"economists now estimate a 90% chance of a 'Voluntary Trade Reset Recession,'\" how about this: \"Experts warn that small businesses are particularly vulnerable to these tariffs, with a high likelihood of a recessionary outcome\"?\n\nIn your third paragraph, you mention major corporations raising prices and slashing profit forecasts. Let's highlight the real-life consequences for American workers more explicitly. For instance, instead of saying \"these pressures are reverberating throughout the economy,\" how about: \"the ripple effects will likely lead to higher costs and reduced job opportunities for working-class Americans\"?\n\nLastly, I think we can strengthen your conclusion by emphasizing the broader implications of these tariffs on global trade growth. Instead of simply stating \"the World Trade Organization has issued a stark warning,\" let's rephrase it as: \"The WTO's warning serves as a sobering reminder that U.S. tariffs could have far-reaching consequences for global economic stability, potentially shaving 1.5% off worldwide GDP\"?\n\nOverall, I believe these suggestions will help your piece more effectively convey the severity of the situation and its impact on American businesses and workers.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to incorporate any of these changes or if you have questions about my feedback."

Could you please review and provide feedback?\nPresident Trump's reimplementation of sweeping tariffs has jolted global markets, with a universal 10% import tax and targeted rates up to 145% on Chinese goods\u2014the highest seen in over a century. The International Monetary Fund swiftly downgraded its U.S. growth forecast, citing heightened uncertainty and widespread supply chain disruptions. Economists now estimate a 90% chance of a \"Voluntary Trade Reset Recession,\" as small businesses disproportionately bear the brunt of rising costs. Major corporations like Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo have begun raising prices and slashing profit forecasts in response to the tariff-driven squeeze on production. These pressures are reverberating throughout the economy, driving up consumer prices and lowering purchasing power. The World Trade Organization has issued a stark warning that the U.S. tariffs could reverse global trade growth, potentially shaving 1.5% off worldwide GDP. While intended as a show of strength in trade negotiations, the tariffs have introduced significant volatility into both domestic and international markets."
